## 🚀 Project Components

### 1. **Anomaly Detection in Sales Data**
- Identify and investigate unusual sales patterns across stores and departments.
- Analyze impact of holidays, markdowns, and economic indicators.
- Implement anomaly handling and cleansing strategies.

### 2. **Time-Based Anomaly Detection**
- Analyze and visualize time-based sales trends.
- Detect seasonality and holiday effects using time-series analysis.

### 3. **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**
- Handle missing values (notably in MarkDown data).
- Engineer new features (e.g., store size, type, geography, economic context).

### 4. **Customer Segmentation Analysis**
- Segment stores/departments based on sales, markdowns, and regional data.
- Profile segments for tailored strategies.

### 5. **Market Basket Analysis**
- Infer product associations within departments.
- Develop cross-sell strategies despite lack of individual transaction data.

### 6. **Demand Forecasting**
- Predict weekly sales at store and department levels.
- Integrate factors like CPI, unemployment, fuel prices, etc.
- Compare short-term and long-term model performance.

### 7. **Impact of External Factors**
- Quantify how economic indicators and climate affect sales.
- Integrate insights into forecasting models.

### 8. **Personalization & Marketing Strategies**
- Propose markdown/promotion strategy per segment.
- Recommend inventory policies based on segmentation and forecast results.

### 9. **Segmentation Quality Evaluation**
- Quantitative metrics to evaluate the separation and cohesiveness of clusters.

### 10. **Real-World Strategy Formulation**
- Develop actionable strategies for inventory management, targeted marketing, and holistic store optimization.
- Discuss operational challenges and mitigation steps.
